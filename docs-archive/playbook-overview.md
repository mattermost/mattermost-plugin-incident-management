# Playbooks and Incidents

During an active incident, you want to focus on triaging and solving the problem as soon as possible. Planning your incident support strategy ahead of time with playbooks is the best way to ensure incidents run smoothly.

Once complete, [incident channels can be exported](https://mattermost.gitbook.io/channel-export-plugin) for analysis. Teams can identify bottlenecks in the incident by seeing time gaps between when checklist items are completed and incorporating necessary changes into the playbook for next incident.
