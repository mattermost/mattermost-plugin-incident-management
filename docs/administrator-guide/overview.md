# Overview

Incidents are situations which require an immediate response and benefit from a clearly defined process guiding towards resolution. Incident Response allows your team to coordinate, manage, and resolve incidents from within Mattermost.

When incidents are monitored, coordinated, and measured effectively, you can add transparency, maximize effectiveness, and save costs by cutting down time taken to respond and resolve incidents.
