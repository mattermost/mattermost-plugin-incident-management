# Telemetry

We only track the events that create, delete, or update items. We never track the specific content of the items. In particular, we do not collect the name of the incidents or the contents of the stages and steps.

Every event we track is accompanied with metadata that help us identify each event and isolate it from the rest of the servers. We can group all events that are coming from a single server, and if that server is licensed, we are able to identify the buyer of the license. The following list details the metadata that accompanies every event:

- `diagnosticID`: Unique identifier of the server the plugin is running on.
- `serverVersion`: Version of the server the plugin is running on.
- `pluginVersion`: Version of the plugin.
- `eventTimeStamp`: Timestamp indicating when the event was queued to send to the server.
- `createdAt`: Timestamp indicating when the event was sent to the server.
- `id`: Unique identifier of the event.
- `event integrations`: Unused field. It always contains the value `null`.
- `event originalTimestamp`: Timestamp indicating when the event actually happened. It always equals `eventTimeStamp`.
- `type`: Type of the event. It always contains the string `track`.
