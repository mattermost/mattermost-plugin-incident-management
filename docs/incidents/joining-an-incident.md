# Joining an Incident

When an incident has been started, it's added to the list of channels in the Mattermost team.

If an incident channel is private new participants can only be added to an incident channel by a channel member. If the incident is public, no invitation is needed - search for, and join, the channel via **Browse Channels** in Mattermost.
