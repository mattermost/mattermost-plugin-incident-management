## Ending an incident

Incident members can end an incident using the slash command `/incident end` from within the incident channel. Ending an incident signals to all participants that the issue has been resolved.

Some playbooks may define stages and tasks to complete after an incident has been resolved, such as scheduling and completing a post-mortem.
