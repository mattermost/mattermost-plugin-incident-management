# Viewing incident details

To view information about ongoing and ended incidents, select **Main Menu > Playbooks & Incidents**. Select the **Incident** tab to view a list of incidents in your team. Select the incident name to view a summary of the incident, jump to the channel, or export the channel.

To view information about ongoing incidents, select the **Incidents** icon in the header of any channel to open the RHS where all ongoing incidents are listed. Select **Go to Incident Channel** to open the relevant channel and see:

- The incident commander
- The current stage
- The remaining tasks
- The finished tasks

You can also:

- Assign a step to yourself or another incident member
- Mark a step as **Complete** or **Incomplete**
- Start an automated action
- Invite new members to the channel

## Editing a playbook during an incident

You can edit a playbook that's being used in an active incident. However, the changes made will only be applied to future incidents - not the active incident, or incidents that previously used that playbook.
