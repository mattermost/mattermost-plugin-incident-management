## Starting an incident

To start an incident, use one of the following steps:

- Use the slash command */incident start* from any channel.
- Select the shield icon in the channel header, and select **+ Start Incident**.
- Use the context menu of a post and select **Start incident**.

You need to select a playbook and name your incident before you can select **Start Incident**. The incident description is optional. Only playbooks that you're a member of are listed in the **Playbook** drop-down menu.

The creator of an incident is automatically added as the first member and becomes the commander. To change commanders, click the current commander's name in the RHS and select the new commander. Only members of the channel may be selected as commanders. To change commander to a user who is not in the channel, first add the user to the channel.

## Joining an incident

When an incident has been started, it's added to the list of channels in the Mattermost team.

If an incident channel is private new participants can only be added to an incident channel by a channel member. If the incident is public, no invitation is needed - search for, and join, the channel via **Browse Channels** in Mattermost.
