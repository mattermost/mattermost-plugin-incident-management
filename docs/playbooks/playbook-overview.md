# Overview

During an active incident, you want to focus on triaging and solving the problem as soon as possible. Planning your incident support strategy ahead of time with playbooks is the best way to ensure incidents run smoothly.

## What are playbooks?

A playbook is a recipe for dealing with and resolving an incident. In a playbook, you can plan ahead so that during an incident responders know exactly what to do. Make sure to schedule a retrospective analysis to iterate on the design of your playbooks after the incident finishes.

Within each playbook, you can create stages and tasks to ensure that items are addressed and completed in sequential order. The tasks can optionally be associated with slash commands and assigned to individual team members.
